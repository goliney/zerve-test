# Welcome to Zerve
Refer to this link for step by step process get started with Zerve Canvas.
https://docs.zerve.ai/guide/welcome-to-zerve/quickstart


## Setup and Build Environments
Each canvas comes with pre installed set of libraries that can be found under Requirements 
in the left pane.You also have the option to add new packages and rebuild the base environement. 
https://docs.zerve.ai/guide/the-zerve-canvas/requirements


## Global Imports
This can be used to specify packages and functions that are needed across all the blocks. 
For example you might need pandas or numpy in multiple blocks - so those can be added here and
larger packages like tensorflow or torch can be imported only in the specific blocks. 
This can also used as a place to define canvas level functions and classes.

## Import Files:
Each canvas comes with a file system to upload files.It supports upto 10GB of file uploads.
This will also be the home directory for the python environment. Folder support will be added soon.

## Import Jupyter Notebooks:
Do you have Jupyter notebooks that you want to use in Zerve? drag and drop them into Zerve 
and we will automatically convert them into a canvas and let you edit, execute and share.

## API Deployments:
Post model development you can setup deployments by adding API Layer. 
Refer to this doc for detailed walkthrough to setup a working API.

## Setting Cache Memory or tmp storage
Some of the python packages and functions like ```sklearn.datasets``` or ```torch.models```
will require a cache memory to work.In such cases you might run into 
**[Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/home/sbx_user1051'** at a block level. 

To bypass this you can set the cache directory for the package to this ```"/tmp/"``` - 
which is the location within each block with write access.

For example,
before importing torch models like vgg16 - add this cache directory reroute.
```python 
import os
os.environ["TORCH_HOME"] = "/tmp/" 
```
for ```sklearn.datasets``` you can pass data_home parameter as ```"/tmp/"```
